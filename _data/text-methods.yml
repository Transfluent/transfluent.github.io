  Parameters: 
    - value: text_id
      desc: Text id (alphanumeric string, recommended max length 64 characters). If group id is provided, text id is visible only in the group (e.g. text ids won't collide between groups).
    - value: group_id
      desc: Group id for texts (alphanumeric string, recommended max length 32 characters). If provided, all text ids in group are visible only in the group (e.g. text ids won't collide between groups).
