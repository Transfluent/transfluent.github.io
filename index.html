            <p style="font-size: 110%;">..to scale from 1 word into millions of words, yet providing excellent quality and having ability to translate into numerous of languages with very little effort from the customer.
                <br><br>Key to fulfill this promise is our innovative use of technology in the translation process. Our API is in the core enabling all this. On this website you will find detailed documentation of our API and description how to the translation process works.
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 3rem;">Get started</h3>
            <p>All of our implementations are built on our API. The translation process over our API is straight forward and simple: authenticate, submit content, place the order and receive the translation (via an API call or by receiving a callback).</p>

                <h4>User accounts</h4>
                To get going, you will need a Transfluent user account. Either <a href="https://www.transfluent.com/en/sign-up/" target="_blank">create a new user account</a> by yourself or ask your company's account owner to create one for you.

                <h4>Development and testing</h4>
                While developing and testing your integration, you probably do not want to spend your own money for testing. Just for that, we provide a <strong>Pseudo language</strong> translation. The language code for pseudo language is <strong>xx-xx</strong> and the language id is <strong>500</strong>. Use English (<code>en-gb</code>) as source language and Pseudo language as target language and the order will be processed for free. Instead of actual translation, you will get your source text reversed (e.g. &quot;Hello&quot; -&gt; &quot;olleH&quot;). Placing Pseudo language orders makes sense for testing the whole process from end to end and depending on your use case possibly to pinpoint any non-translated parts on your end.

                <h4>Supported languages</h4>
                <a href="https://www.transfluent.com/en/pricing/#supported-language-pairs">Check supported language pairs</a> from our website or call our API's <strong>languages</strong> method to list languages names and language pairs. The API methods can be called using ready-made clients or command line tools, for example call using <strong>curl</strong>: <code>curl https://transfluent.com/languages/</code> or you can even do it with your browser: <a href="https://transfluent.com/languages/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">HTTP GET https://transfluent.com/languages/</a>. The output is always <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">JSON</a>. As you can see, it is easy to get started with the API.

                <h4>Payments</h4>
                The easiest way to pay is by credit card. You or your company's account owner can setup a credit card in <a href="https://www.transfluent.com/my-account/#/creditcard" target="_blank">My Account</a>. It is recommended to add a backup card so there will not be any interruption in the service if the primary card fails. If you prefer invoicing, please contact <a href="mailto:sales@transfluent.com">sales</a>.

                <h4>Use cases</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>API v2/text*:</strong> Plain text and HTML content. Content is stored by key (and group). Our backend keeps track of versions, so unchanged texts will not be re-translated.</li>
                    <li><strong>API v2/file*:</strong> Resource files. Usually integrated to the application build process. Our backend keeps track of file versions, so unchanged parts will not be re-translated.</li>
                    <li><strong>Translation <a href="https://www.transfluent.com/translate/" target="_blank">Widget</a>:</strong> ad-hoc translation needs, delivery by email. Text or files. <a href="https://transfluent.partners/integrate/" target="_blank">Embedded version</a> available for intranet.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Please note</h4>
                <p>We would like to remind you of few important points that might cause issues later on if not addressed early on.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Charset encoding. We always provide UTF-8 or UTF-16 encoded content. We highly recommend to use UTF-8.</li>
                    <li>Writing direction. Some languages are written from right to left, e.g. Arabic.</li>
                    <li>Plurals. Some languages have more plural forms than two.</li>
                    <li>Space. Some languages need more space in length on a screen and also in bytes on a storage device. This is utmost important if your translation has either limited storage length or if the text must fit on screen. We provide <a href="https://www.transfluent.com/en/appstore-description-estimator/" target="_blank">a tool</a> to estimate translation size for AppStore descriptions, it can be used for other estimation purposes as well.</li>
                    <li>Tags/placeholders. Instead of combining strings (e.g. &quot;Hello &quot; + name), prefer using tags and placeholders (e.g. &quot; Hello [name]&quot;). That is because some language have different order of words and therefore combining strings might be problematic. Our translation system supports and our translators are familiar with the most common tags for each resource type but if you are translating plain text, it might be worthwhile to mention about your tags/placeholders in the translator instructions.</li>
                    <li>Tone&amp;context. Please provide as accurate instructions and supporting context as you can, it will help the translators to do a better job.</li>
                    <li>Hardcoded content. To fully localize a website or a game, you might encounter issues with some content being &quot;hardcoded&quot; in the source language. This is usually the case with images and strings that are not passed through the localization system. To identify these, you can use our Pseudo language as target language and then see if all content gets reversed or not.</li>
                </ul>
