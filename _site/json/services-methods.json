[{"Name":"Testing","Description":"For development and testing your integration, we provide a <strong>Pseudo language</strong> translation. The language code for Pseudo language is <strong>xx-xx</strong>. Use English (<code>en</code>) as source language and Pseudo language as target language and the order will be processed for free. Instead of actual translation, you will get your source text reversed (e.g. &quot;Hello&quot; -&gt; &quot;olleH&quot;). Placing Pseudo language orders is useful for testing the whole process from end to end and, depending on your use case, possibly also for pinpointing any non-translated parts on your end."},{"Name":"Callbacks","Description":"Callbacks will be explained on this page soon."}]
