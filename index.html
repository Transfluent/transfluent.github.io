                <h4>Payments</h4>
                The easiest way to pay is by credit card. You or your company's account owner can setup a credit card in the <a href="https://www.transfluent.com/my-account/#/creditcard" target="_blank">My Account</a> page. It is recommended to add a backup card so there will not be any interruption in the service if the primary card fails. <!-- If you prefer invoicing, please contact <a href="mailto:sales@transfluent.com">sales</a>. -->

                <h4>Use cases</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>API v2/text*:</strong> Plain text and HTML content. Content is stored by key (and group). Our backend keeps track of versions, so unchanged texts will not be re-translated.</li>
                    <li><strong>API v2/file*:</strong> Resource files. Usually integrated to the application build process. Our backend keeps track of file versions, so unchanged parts will not be re-translated.</li>
                    <li><strong>Translation <a href="https://www.transfluent.com/translate/" target="_blank">Widget</a>:</strong> ad-hoc translation needs, delivery by email. Text or files. <a href="https://transfluent.partners/integrate/" target="_blank">Embedded version</a> available for intranet.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Translation process example</h4>
                <h5>Setting up phase</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Authenticate:</strong> Retrieve a token from the API and store it locally</li>
                    <li><strong>Retrieve list of languages:</strong> Retrieve list of language names&codes and supported pairs from the API. It is recommended to refresh the listing every now and then as our list of languages and supported pairs increases often.</li>
                </ol>
                <h5>Continuous translation phase</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Save</strong> new content to the API by calling /v2/text/ or /v2/file/save/</li>
                    <li><strong>Order</strong> translations by calling /v2/texts/translate/ or /v2/file/translate/</li>
                    <li><strong>Receive a callback</strong> and handle completed translations on your end. Alternatively you can poll /v2/text/status/ or /v2/file/status/ to see if the translations have been completed.</li>
                    <li>If you did not process the callback, you can <strong>retrieve the translations</strong> by calling /v2/text/ or /v2/file/read/.</li>
                    <li><strong>Now you are done.</strong> To translate more, go to first step of this phase.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Please note</h4>
                <p>We would like to remind you of few important points that might cause issues later on if not addressed early on.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Charset encoding.</strong> We always provide UTF-8 or UTF-16 encoded content. We highly recommend to use UTF-8.</li>
                    <li><strong>Writing direction.</strong> Some languages are written from right to left, e.g. Arabic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Plurals.</strong> Some languages have more plural forms than two.</li>
                    <li><strong>Space.</strong> Some languages need more space in length on a screen and also in bytes on a storage device. This is utmost important if your translation has either limited storage length or if the text must fit on screen. We provide <a href="https://www.transfluent.com/en/appstore-description-estimator/" target="_blank">a tool</a> to estimate translation size for AppStore descriptions, it can be used for other estimation purposes as well.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tags/placeholders.</strong> Instead of combining strings (e.g. &quot;Hello &quot; + name), prefer using tags and placeholders (e.g. &quot; Hello [name]&quot;). That is because some language have different order of words and therefore combining strings might be problematic. Our translation system supports and our translators are familiar with the most common tags for each resource type but if you are translating plain text, it might be worthwhile to mention about your tags/placeholders in the translator instructions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tone&amp;context.</strong> Please provide as accurate instructions and supporting context as you can, it will help the translators to do a better job.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hardcoded content.</strong> To fully localize a website or a game, you might encounter issues with some content being &quot;hardcoded&quot; in the source language. This is usually the case with images and strings that are not passed through the localization system. To identify these, you can use our Pseudo language as target language and then see if all content gets reversed or not.</li>
