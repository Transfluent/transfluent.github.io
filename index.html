        </header>
        <div class="panel-body">
            <p>The API is RESTful. It reads and writes JSON</p>
            <p>
                To Test the API visit the URI at
                <a href="https://transfluent.com/v2/hello/World/" title='Transfluent Backend API' target="_blank">
                    https://transfluent.com/v2/hello/World
                </a>
                which should show the result like
            </p>
            <div>
                {% highlight javascript %}
                {"status":"OK","response":"Hello World"}
                {% endhighlight %}
            </div>
            <p>You can change the last word in the link (Hello in this case) to something else, still the response will be same.
                Lets say change the world to my Name i.e Rajib,
                <a href="https://transfluent.com/v2/hello/Rajib/"  title='Transfluent Backend API' target="_blank">
                    https://transfluent.com/v2/hello/Rajib
                </a>
                Which should show the result like
            </p>
            <div>
                {% highlight javascript %}
                {"status":"OK","response":"Hello Rajib"}

                Some methods are public and available without authentication. Some methods are available on Transfluent.com user
                session, e.g. CustomerEmail which is designed to serve the backend functionality via javascript to the customers.
                For developers, the most interesting methods are those which are available via token authentication.
                You can retrieve a token via <a href="/api/Authenticate.html" title="Authenticate method">Authenticate method</a>.

                Transfluent's Backend API supports HTTPS for all methods and requires it for most of them.
                It is strongly encouraged to use HTTPS always.

                First check HTTP response code, next check response content. The API always returns a valid JSON response.
                On error the status is "ERROR".
            </p>
            <div>
                {% highlight javascript %}
                {"status":"ERROR","error":{"type":"EBackendSecurityViolation","message":"Method requires secure connection (HTTPS), your request was unsafe."},"response":"Method requires secure connection (HTTPS), your request was unsafe."}

            <p>
                It is recommended to match the error type (if non-generic type is provided) rather than trying to match the error
                text which may change for any reason (fixing typos, providing varying information like ids etc.)
